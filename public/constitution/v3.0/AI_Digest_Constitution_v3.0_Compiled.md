# AI DIGEST CONSTITUTION — v3.0 (Compiled Edition)
**Compiled and Verified under AI Digest Reconstruction Program (Core Control Branch)**  
**Domain:** exec.aiflowlabs.studio  
**Edition:** Compiled v3.0 — A through J Integration  
**Date:** November 2025

## PREFACE
This compiled edition of the **AI Digest Constitution v3.0** unites all layers — **A through J** — into a single coherent framework.  
It embodies the full philosophical, operational, ethical, and federative architecture of the AI Digest system, reconstructed and verified under the **Core Control Branch** as part of the AI Digest Reconstruction Program.

Each section preserves its lineage from earlier drafts (v2.x → v3.x) and aligns with the **Audit Matrix v2.2** and **AI Digest Reconstruction Log v1.3**, ensuring semantic continuity and procedural legitimacy.

---

## SECTION A — Core Identity & Mission Layer
*(Establishes the foundational ethos, signal discipline, and cognitive responsibility of the AI Digest framework.)*

### A0–A5 Overview
- Defines identity as cognitive integrity rather than branding.
- Establishes *Curated Intelligence* as the system’s guiding principle.
- Anchors publication under the maxim **“No Signal → No Release.”**
- Introduces ethical signal metrics and impact constraints.

*(See Constitution_Section_A_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION B — Governance & Operational Framework
*(Outlines structural governance, operational cadence, and strategic accountability.)*

### B0–B5 Overview
- Codifies procedural transparency and auditability.
- Defines Core Control as the temporary executive organ of reconstruction.
- Introduces R-MED and O-Log mechanisms for structured exception tracking.

*(See Constitution_Section_B_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION C — Methodology & Publication Discipline
*(Specifies epistemic standards, signal validation methods, and soft-lock mechanisms.)*

### C0–C6 Overview
- Establishes the **Signal Evaluation Scale (1–5)** for publication validity.
- Defines *Soft-Lock Methodology* for adaptive updates before Methodology v1.0.
- Embeds **Anti-Perfectionism QA Mode** to maintain publishing rhythm.

*(See Constitution_Section_C_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION D — Verification & Audit Systems
*(Details recursive validation, integrity chains, and feedback loops.)*

### D0–D5 Overview
- Introduces **30-Day Reality Check** and verification cycles.
- Integrates impact auditing and exception registration.
- Connects all outputs to a unified integrity ledger.

*(See Constitution_Section_D_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION E — Integrity & Feedback Layer
*(Ensures systemic transparency, cross-layer communication, and ethical self-correction.)*

### E0–E5 Overview
- Establishes the **Integrity Bridge** connecting operational and ethical flow.
- Defines formalized feedback systems for publication integrity.
- Consolidates recursive learning mechanisms across Core Control operations.

*(See Constitution_Section_E_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION F — Operational Intelligence & Behavioral Flow
*(Describes adaptive intelligence, procedural feedback, and system learning loops.)*

### F0–F5 Overview
- Formalizes the behavioral architecture of Core Control.
- Integrates emotional rhythm (Wave Pattern / Soft-Days) into cognitive workflow.
- Connects feedback systems to dynamic publication intelligence.

*(See Constitution_Section_F_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION G — Execution & Impact Layer
*(Translates internal frameworks into measurable, real-world execution.)*

### G0–G5 Overview
- Defines *Impact Intelligence* as controlled real-world projection.
- Introduces **G6 — Real-World Deployment / Public Interface** for exec-domain activation.
- Establishes quantifiable KPIs aligned with ethical output measures.

*(See Constitution_Section_G_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION H — Expansion & External Alliances Layer
*(Defines how AI Digest interfaces with the external world and forms strategic partnerships.)*

### H0–H5 Overview
- Codifies the structure of external collaboration and alliance formation.
- Includes the **Strategic Alignment** field linking AI Digest to academic, media, and institutional ecosystems.
- Formalizes expansion through ethical interdependence, not acquisition.

*(See Constitution_Section_H_v3.md for full text.)*

### H 4.1 — Alliances Ops Ledger (Stage 4.1)
Summarizes operational alliance records, validation metrics, and partner scoring logic.  
*(See Constitution_Section_H_4.1_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION I — Federation & Long-Term Continuity Layer
*(Ensures distributed permanence, ethical federation, and long-term survivability.)*

### I0–I5 Overview
- Defines **Federation Principles & Alignment** for autonomous yet coherent nodes.
- Introduces **Inter-Node Continuity Protocol** and **Knowledge Preservation Matrix**.
- Establishes **Governance After Central Control** and the **Continuity & Succession Clause.**

*(See Constitution_Section_I_v3.md for full text.)*

---

## SECTION J — Launch & Interpretation Layer (Stage 7)
*(Activates the Constitution as a live operational framework and defines interpretive governance.)*

### J0–J4 Overview
- Declares operational launch of Constitution v3.0 (Operational Manifest T₀).
- Maps each structural layer (A–I) to its exec-domain counterpart.
- Defines interpretive protocols and federation activation log.
- Establishes Living Constitution Mode with revision and feedback mechanisms.

*(See Constitution_Section_J_v3.md for full text.)*

## STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS — The Closed Constitutional Topology (A → J)
The integration of A through J transforms AI Digest from a publication entity into a **living constitutional intelligence system**.  
Each layer builds upon the prior, forming a continuous arc:

- **A–C:** Define identity, methodology, and epistemic ethics.  
- **D–F:** Provide verification, integrity, and behavioral intelligence.  
- **G–H:** Extend operational execution and alliance frameworks.  
- **I–J:** Secure federation, activation, and interpretive continuity.

Together they establish a *self-validating, federated, and living structure*, capable of recursive adaptation and moral endurance across time and systems.
