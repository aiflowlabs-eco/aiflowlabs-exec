## Narrative Bridge

Section G established direct deployment of internal systems into the public domain.  
Section H extends that movement outward—formalizing relationships, codifying responsibility,  
and setting the ethical perimeter for every interaction beyond the organization’s borders.  
Where Section E defined integrity within, Section H defines discipline without.  
Expansion is not proliferation; it is structured alignment.

---

## H0 — Expansion Mandate
Expansion exists only when purpose outweighs exposure.  
The Mandate defines thresholds for legitimacy: measurable public value, reciprocal knowledge flow,  
and preservation of methodological independence.  
Every outward initiative must originate from a verified internal signal (G-Series)  
and undergo a dual audit—impact and risk—before activation.  
No alliance or integration is recognized unless it strengthens the system’s mission clarity.

---

## H1 — Alliances & Partnership Framework
Partnerships form the external nervous system of AI Digest.  
They are governed by transparency, reversibility, and value symmetry.  
Each partner is classified as **strategic**, **operational**, or **symbolic**,  
depending on the degree of data exchange and governance overlap.  
Dissolution procedures are mandatory at inception—  
a partnership without an exit protocol is considered void.  
Periodic re-evaluation (every 12 months) maintains ethical and performance equilibrium.

---

## H2 — Cross-Platform Integration Protocols
Integration is both a technical and philosophical act.  
All external API links, data pipelines, or federated exchanges must comply with  
the **Integrity Interface Standard v1.0**, ensuring auditability,  
minimal data retention, and explicit consent tracking.  
Reciprocal integrations require sandbox validation before live deployment.  
No third-party system may access AI Digest datasets without dual-key authorization  
and independent checksum verification of transmitted content.

---

## H3 — Public Representation & Diplomatic Conduct
Every public statement, post, or appearance constitutes institutional speech.  
Representatives operate under the **Four-Tone Code**—accuracy, restraint, coherence, respect.  
Narrative deviations are logged as communicative anomalies and reviewed quarterly.  
The organization speaks as a unified cognitive entity,  
never through personal sentiment.  
Diplomatic presence in external forums is granted only to certified envoys  
who complete the Communication Integrity Module (CIM).

---

## H4 — Institutional & Academic Collaboration
Academic alliances serve as mirrors for methodological rigor.  
Joint research agreements must guarantee open publication rights,  
shared peer review, and reproducibility of data models.  
Partnerships with universities, think-tanks, or standards bodies  
extend the ethical frontier of the ecosystem rather than its market reach.  
AI Digest contributes to global discourse on AI ethics, epistemology, and governance  
while retaining editorial sovereignty over its findings.

---

## H5 — Cultural & Media Alliances
Cultural partnerships convert intelligence into resonance.  
Collaboration with artistic, cinematic, or journalistic domains  
must protect semantic integrity and prevent sensational distortion.  
Media alliances are authorized only through  
the **Contextual Fidelity Clause (CFC)** ensuring faithful representation  
of research and outcomes.  
Public narratives must emphasize humanistic alignment over technological spectacle.

---

## H6 — Global Network Governance
As the ecosystem evolves into a distributed network,  
Section H6 defines its supranational structure.  
Each node (regional or thematic) operates under a charter  
derived from the Core Constitution but adapted to local law and culture.  
A **Council of Custodians** coordinates inter-node ethics,  
data flows, and publication timing.  
No regional node may self-declare independence; legitimacy is conferred by  
the **Core Integrity Registry (CIR)** maintained by AIFlow Labs Studio.

---

## H7 — Safeguards & Boundary Control
Expansion is meaningless without controlled permeability.  
All external interfaces are monitored by the **Boundary Integrity System (BIS)**  
which audits inbound and outbound signals for drift, bias, or coercion.  
Any breach triggers immediate containment and review by  
the **Internal Ethics Board (IEB)**.  
Section H7 therefore acts as the immune system of the outward body—  
preserving coherence while allowing selective exchange.

## Appendix A — Alliance Evaluation Matrix v1.0

| Criterion | Description | Weight | Scoring Range | Evaluation Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Mission Alignment** | Degree to which partner’s mission complements AI Digest ethics & purpose. | 25 % | 1–5 | Must exceed 3 to qualify. |
| **Transparency** | Clarity of governance, funding, and data handling. | 20 % | 1–5 | Public documentation required. |
| **Ethical Compliance** | Conformity with Integrity Layer (E-Series) principles. | 20 % | 1–5 | External audit may be requested. |
| **Reciprocity Value** | Mutual contribution of knowledge, data, or visibility. | 15 % | 1–5 | Zero-sum alliances are disqualified. |
| **Stability & Longevity** | Operational reliability and continuity potential. | 10 % | 1–5 | Score < 3 requires probation. |
| **Innovation Potential** | Capacity to generate novel frameworks or tools. | 10 % | 1–5 | Optional but recommended metric. |

**Total Threshold for Approval:** ≥ 4.0 weighted average  
Evaluations are archived in the **Alliance Ledger**, reviewed semi-annually.
