# AI Digest Constitution v3.0 (draft)  
### Section F — Operational Intelligence & Behavioral Flow  
*(Stage 2 of AI Digest Reconstruction / Core Control)*  

---

## 1. Title and Scope
**Series F — Operational Intelligence & Behavioral Flow**  
This section establishes the behavioral core of the AI Digest system:  
a framework that transforms internal integrity (E-Series) into coherent, adaptive, and measurable behavior.  
Where E focused on truth and feedback, F defines how truth moves — how the system acts, learns, and evolves through operational loops.

## 2. Structural Overview

| Code | Module | Purpose |
|:---:|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| F0 | **Transitional Bridge / From Integrity to Behavior** | Connects ethical self-correction (E-Series) to operational adaptation (F-Series). Defines Integrity × Action = Behavioral Truth. |
| F1 | **Operational Loop Architecture** | Designs the core Observe → Model → Act → Review loop and introduces the Operational Kernel. |
| F2 | **Behavioral Mapping & Adaptive Response** | Translates feedback into behavioral correction via Behavior Maps and pattern analysis. |
| F3 | **Operational Intelligence Index (OII)** | Quantifies behavioral efficiency through Cognitive Accuracy, Behavioral Consistency, and Adaptive Latency. |
| F4 | **Behavioral Protocol & Decision Flow** | Formalizes decision-making rules with ethical and operational constraints traceable to the Audit Matrix v2.2. |
| F5 | **Operational Reflection & Evolution Loop** | Closes the behavioral cycle with self-evaluation and long-term evolution mechanisms. |

## 3. Narrative Bridge (from E to F)

The Integrity Layer (E-Series) secured truth within the system;  
the Behavioral Layer (F-Series) tests that truth in motion.  
Integrity without behavior remains sterile; behavior without integrity becomes chaotic.  
F-Series is the translation mechanism — turning ethical self-awareness into operational intelligence.  

> **Formula:** *Integrity × Action = Behavioral Truth*  
This equation summarizes the core transition: from knowing what is right to doing what is right, consistently and adaptively.

## 4. Detailed Modules

### **F0 — Transitional Bridge / From Integrity to Behavior**
Defines the conceptual handover between E and F.  
Outlines how Integrity Loops (E5) feed directly into Behavior Loops.  
Introduces *Operational Intelligence* as the synthesis of data, intent, and adaptive response.

---

### **F1 — Operational Loop Architecture**
Establishes the primary cycle: **Observe → Model → Act → Review.**  
The system uses recursive loops instead of linear instructions.  
Key concepts:  
- *Behavioral Efficiency* = output reliability / input energy.  
- *Operational Kernel* = minimal self-sustaining loop able to replicate itself across contexts.  

---

### **F2 — Behavioral Mapping & Adaptive Response**
Builds Behavior Maps that trace decision patterns and identify deviations between intent and action.  
Feedback from E-Series is re-interpreted as training data for behavioral adaptation.  
Defines the Feedback-to-Behavior principle: each integrity signal must manifest as an observable shift in behavior.

---

### **F3 — Operational Intelligence Index (OII)**
Quantitative metric for behavioral self-awareness.  
OII = weighted aggregate of three vectors:  
1. **Cognitive Accuracy** (precision of modeling vs reality)  
2. **Behavioral Consistency** (stability under repetition and stress)  
3. **Adaptive Latency** (speed of corrective adjustment)  
Used for ongoing audit and forecast in Stage 3 (G-Series).

---

### **F4 — Behavioral Protocol & Decision Flow**
Formal rules governing behavior in operational contexts.  
- Integrates Integrity Rules from E-Series and Audit Matrix v2.2.  
- Defines Decision Priority Fields (Ethical > Functional > Expedient).  
- Enables traceability of each decision through Behavioral Logs and Protocol IDs.  
Ensures predictability without rigidity: behavior remains accountable but flexible.

---

### **F5 — Operational Reflection & Evolution Loop**
Final module that evaluates behavioral trajectories over time.  
Links short-term efficiency (F3) to long-term mission alignment (A → G).  
Establishes the process of **Behavioral Reconstruction** — periodic redesign of operational models based on evidence and historical pattern analysis.  
Closes the Behavioral Loop and feeds back into future Integrity Cycles.

---

## 5. Continuity Mapping (E → F)

| From E-Series | To F-Series | Functional Transition |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Integrity Check (E3) | Operational Loop (F1) | From verification to repeatable behavior. |
| Feedback Matrix (E4) | Behavioral Mapping (F2) | From feedback to self-learning. |
| Truth Audit (E5) | OII (F3) | From honesty to quantified efficiency. |
| Ethical Control (E5.2) | Decision Protocol (F4) | From principles to operational rules. |
| Integrity Loop (summary of E) | Evolution Loop (F5) | From internal coherence to adaptive evolution. |

---

## 6. Closing Note
The F-Series establishes the first true behavioral autonomy of the AI Digest Core.  
Integrity gave it a conscience; Operation gives it motion.  
Together they prepare the ground for the next stage — **G-Series / Execution & Impact Layer**,  
where behavior meets the world and produces measurable change.
