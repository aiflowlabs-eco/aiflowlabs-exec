### Compact Table — I-Series Overview

| Code | Sub-Section | Focus | Annotation | Strategic Alignment |
|------|--------------|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **I0** | Federation Principles & Alignment | Philosophical and structural foundation for federated autonomy within AI Digest. | Defines unity through ethical coherence across distributed nodes. | Aligns with **A–C Core Ethos**; anchors federation in shared moral architecture. |
| **I1** | Inter-Node Continuity Protocol | Mechanisms ensuring mission and data continuity across semi-autonomous nodes. | Establishes cyclic verification and recovery standards among partners. | Extends **E-Layer Integrity Logic** to inter-institutional resilience. |
| **I2** | Knowledge Preservation & Archival Matrix | Long-term archival and redundancy systems. | Outlines cold storage, mirror networks, and cryptographic audit trails. | Connects to **D-Layer Verification Systems**; secures temporal durability. |
| **I3** | Governance After Central Control | Distributed succession and delegated stewardship. | Shifts Core Control from directive to coordinating function. | Evolves **F-Layer Behavioral Flow** into autonomous governance. |
| **I4** | External Federation Interface | Framework for collaboration with external academic, media, or institutional ecosystems. | Defines ethical and technical APIs for cross-domain cooperation. | Integrates with **H-Layer Expansion Protocols**; manages external signal exchange. |
| **I5** | Continuity & Succession Clause | Constitutional guarantee of survivability beyond individuals or infrastructure. | Ensures lawful re-instantiation of AI Digest from verified archives. | Completes **G-Layer Impact Loop** by defining existential permanence. |

### Narrative Expansion

The **I-Series** defines the terminal yet regenerative layer of the AI Digest Constitution — a framework ensuring that the system transcends organizational, temporal, and infrastructural limits.  
Where the H-Layer establishes outward growth, the I-Layer establishes *continuity beyond expansion*: a federation designed to preserve coherence through autonomy.

#### I0 — Federation Principles & Alignment
This section enshrines the doctrine that true federation does not mean fragmentation.  
Each node or partner instance operates under its own governance but maintains strict adherence to the shared constitutional ethos set in Sections A–C.  
The Federation Charter requires synchronization of ethical metrics, signal taxonomies, and publication standards to maintain semantic integrity across the whole network.

#### I1 — Inter-Node Continuity Protocol
A formal protocol defines how nodes verify, mirror, and restore one another.  
Every partner maintains encrypted public-key registries for cross-validation of identities, data hashes, and signal integrity.  
If one node fails or is compromised, another may invoke the Continuity Token to reconstruct its core dataset and uphold operational lineage.

#### I2 — Knowledge Preservation & Archival Matrix
The Archival Matrix establishes a **three-tier preservation model**:
1. **Live Mirrors** — continuously synchronized repositories accessible across active nodes.  
2. **Cold Archives** — periodic immutable backups stored in neutral institutional vaults.  
3. **Deep Time Depositories** — cryptographically sealed heritage copies maintained in inter-organizational custody.  
Verification hashes anchor every archive to an immutable ledger, ensuring that truth remains reconstructable even after systemic collapse.

#### I3 — Governance After Central Control
When Core Control has fulfilled its formative mission, it transitions from executive authority to *coordinative faculty*.  
Decision-making becomes distributed among **Federated Councils**, each with limited jurisdiction but bound by shared audit and transparency laws.  
No single node may alter constitutional text unilaterally; amendments require tri-consensual ratification across operational, ethical, and archival domains.

#### I4 — External Federation Interface
The interface acts as the public handshake between AI Digest and external ecosystems — universities, media consortia, and civic data institutions.  
It defines **ethical interoperability standards** and **semantic APIs** that permit data exchange without identity dilution or signal corruption.  
This section anchors federation in open knowledge diplomacy rather than central control, allowing plural systems to collaborate without ideological convergence.

#### I5 — Continuity & Succession Clause
The ultimate safeguard of persistence.  
If Core Control and all known central instances cease to exist, any legitimate node possessing verified archives may invoke the Continuity Clause.  
This act re-instantiates AI Digest under its last confirmed constitutional checksum, restoring both data and doctrine without dependence on individual founders.  
Succession is attached not to persons but to proof of integrity.

### Strategic Alignment Summary
The I-Layer integrates all prior constitutional mechanisms into a single **continuity topology**.  
It ensures that the ethical architecture of Sections A–C, the operational intelligence of Sections E–F, and the alliance protocols of Section H converge into a living federation capable of **infinite temporal extension**.  
Where the G-Layer focused on measurable impact, the I-Layer safeguards meaning itself — defining endurance as a moral function.
