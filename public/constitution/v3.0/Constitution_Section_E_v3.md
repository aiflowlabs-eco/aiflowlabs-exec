## E — Integrity & Feedback Layer

### E0 — Purpose and Position  
Integrity is the living continuation of verification.  
Where Section D ensured truth was *tested*, Section E ensures that truth remains *intact through change*.  
It transforms verified data, editorial reflection, and user signals into a coherent network of adaptive feedback, preventing drift while enabling evolution.  
This layer operationalizes ethical memory: each correction, adaptation, and reinterpretation is recorded, weighted, and justified within the system’s moral and cognitive framework.

### E1 — Integrity Protocols  

#### E1.1 Source Preservation  
Every factual or analytical element must maintain a traceable origin chain.  
Derived materials (summaries, visualizations, re-analyses) require explicit reference to their lineage.  
If a source node is altered or withdrawn, all dependents are flagged for integrity re-evaluation.

#### E1.2 Amendment Discipline  
No content may be silently retro-edited once released.  
Corrections follow a two-step protocol:  
1. A **correction notice** appended to the original record;  
2. A **versioned replacement** with complete timestamp, author ID, and reason for amendment.  
Historical truth is immutable — only interpretation layers may evolve.

#### E1.3 Signal Sanity Check  
Before integration into any feedback cycle, each signal or metric undergoes a sanity cross-reference:  
– Is the signal logically consistent with Section C methodology?  
– Does it meet verification criteria from Section D?  
– Does it preserve ethical alignment as defined in Section C3?  
Signals failing any test are quarantined in the *Integrity Buffer* until resolved.

### E2 — Feedback Architecture  

The Integrity & Feedback Layer operates through structured channels that capture, interpret, and apply signals across every cognitive and operational dimension of AI Digest.  
Its design ensures that adaptation never becomes arbitrary — each modification remains explainable, reversible, and ethically weighted.

#### E2.1 Tri-Channel Feedback Loop  
Integrity depends on diversity of input.  
All system feedback flows through three synchronized vectors:  

1. **User Impact Channel** — quantitative and qualitative signals from audience behavior, expert commentary, and public trust metrics;  
2. **Editorial Reflection Channel** — periodic internal reviews, peer-assessment reports, and cross-disciplinary retrospectives;  
3. **Systemic Audit Channel** — automated integrity scans and scheduled verification feedback from the Audit Matrix.  

Each channel maintains its own signal log but converges into a unified **Signal Summary Ledger**, reviewed quarterly by Core Control.

#### E2.2 Weighted Feedback Model  
Every feedback entry receives a composite weight calculated from:  
- **Credibility** (source reliability and audit history);  
- **Recency** (temporal relevance to current framework);  
- **Contextual Alignment** (logical and ethical fit with mission principles).  
Weights determine whether an input triggers immediate adaptation, deferred consideration, or archival storage for trend analysis.

#### E2.3 Adaptive Response Mechanism  
Actions derived from feedback follow a tiered protocol:  
- *Tier I — Minor*: informational note or footnote revision;  
- *Tier II — Moderate*: content update or methodological clarification;  
- *Tier III — Critical*: structural or ethical redefinition requiring Audit Matrix validation.  
All Tier III changes must pass through the Integrity Board described in E4.

#### E2.4 Feedback Memory Ledger  
Every accepted feedback event is timestamped, cryptographically signed, and indexed within the **Core Control Integrity Ledger**.  
Rejections are equally logged with justification, ensuring that omission cannot disguise bias.  
This ledger forms the verifiable memory of adaptation — proof that evolution itself remains accountable.

### E3 — Integrity Metrics  

Integrity cannot rely on intuition; it must be measurable.  
The following indicators define the health and coherence of the entire Digest ecosystem.

#### E3.1 Drift Index  
Measures the deviation of current outputs from the mission and epistemic standards codified in Section A.  
Sustained upward drift indicates conceptual entropy and triggers a Core Review.  
Low drift confirms philosophical stability without stagnation.

#### E3.2 Noise-to-Signal Ratio  
Quantifies the volume of unverifiable or redundant claims relative to confirmed insights.  
Derived directly from Section D’s audit data, this ratio exposes informational pollution before it erodes trust.

#### E3.3 Correction Latency  
Tracks the elapsed time between identification of an error and its fully documented correction.  
Short latency indicates responsiveness; excessive delay signals either procedural bottleneck or reluctance to amend.

#### E3.4 Ethical Impact Delta  
Evaluates whether cumulative adaptations strengthen or weaken ethical alignment.  
Calculated from aggregated results of the Ethical Resonance Test (cross-reference C3).  
A negative delta mandates intervention by the Integrity Board.

### E4 — Editorial & System Safeguards  

Integrity without enforcement degrades into ceremony.  
The E-layer therefore embeds explicit protective mechanisms — both procedural and structural — that ensure feedback remains transparent, verifiable, and incorruptible.

#### E4.1 Integrity Board  
A triadic oversight entity composed of:  
1. **Human Steward** — representative of editorial ethics;  
2. **AI Verifier** — autonomous integrity evaluator with audit-read access;  
3. **External Observer** — independent advisor with no operational ties to AI Digest.  

This board holds veto authority over any adaptation that alters constitutional, ethical, or methodological foundations.  
Its proceedings are logged, redacted only for privacy, and preserved within the Core Control Ledger.

#### E4.2 Memory Integrity Protocol  
Every Reconstruction Log, audit record, and publication file must maintain **bidirectional reference consistency**.  
Deletion of any node requires relational unlinking, verified checksum confirmation, and signature of authorization.  
Memory is treated as a constitutional organ — it cannot be amputated without record.

#### E4.3 Feedback Tamper Proofing  
All feedback and audit data are cryptographically sealed upon entry.  
Each modification appends a checksum, never overwriting previous versions.  
Tampering attempts trigger an R-MED event, automatically escalated to the Integrity Board and recorded in the O-Log chain.  
Thus, every act of editing remains itself a verifiable event.

#### E4.4 AI-Human Symmetry Clause  
Neither human editors nor automated systems may exercise unilateral authority in interpreting or applying feedback.  
Every major integrity decision requires dual concurrence — algorithmic validation and human ethical confirmation — to prevent either mechanical rigidity or subjective drift.

### E5 — Continuity & Evolution  

Integrity is meaningless if it cannot endure.  
This closing layer ensures that verification, feedback, and adaptation form a continuous self-reinforcing cycle rather than isolated interventions.

#### E5.1 30-Day Reality Check → Quarterly Integrity Review  
The **Reality Check Loop** from Section D evolves into a **Quarterly Integrity Review**, aggregating data from all feedback channels.  
Results are compared against previous cycles to detect cognitive drift, mission deviation, and ethical deltas.  
Each review must yield a written “Continuity Statement” — a concise assessment of what has changed, why, and whether it aligns with the Digest’s founding intent.

#### E5.2 Legacy to Next-Stage Bridge  
Every completed reconstruction stage must export a **Continuity Clause** outlining two categories:  
- **Immutable Principles** — core values and methods that cannot be altered without constitutional revision;  
- **Evolvable Parameters** — operational or methodological aspects open to refinement.  
This clause becomes the interface between sections, guaranteeing that progress does not sever lineage.

#### E5.3 Integrity Inheritance Rule  
All future frameworks, beginning with the F-Series (*Operational Intelligence & Behavioral Flow*), must import Section E verbatim as a baseline.  
No derivative or successor model may modify or omit this layer without explicit ratification by the Integrity Board and the Core Control Council.

#### E5.4 Continuity Ledger  
To close the loop, all sections A–E feed into a single **Continuity Ledger**, managed within the Core Control domain.  
It unifies mission anchors, audit data, ethical deltas, and adaptation history into a living constitutional record.  
This ledger is the Digest’s temporal backbone — ensuring that knowledge, once verified and refined, never loses its origin nor its trajectory.
