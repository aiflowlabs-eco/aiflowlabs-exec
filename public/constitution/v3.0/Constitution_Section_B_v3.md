# Section B — Governance & Ops Framework (v3.1 patch)
**Project:** AI Digest Reconstruction / Core Control  
**Linked Docs:** Constitution v3.0 (draft), Audit Matrix v2.2, Reconstruction Log v1.0

## B0 — Overview
The Governance & Operations Framework defines how intent becomes execution inside the AI Digest Core Control system.  
If Section A establishes why the Digest exists, Section B establishes how it functions every day —  
through clear authority, rhythmic operations, and transparent feedback.

Formula: **Principles → Structure → Flow → Release**

---

## B1 — Governance Principles
Governance is the architecture of control — the system that ensures alignment, integrity, and accountability.

**Foundational principles:**  
1. **Transparency** — decisions, data sources, and authorship are traceable.  
2. **Accountability** — every mandate has an identifiable owner and review path.  
3. **Integrity** — truth and accuracy override convenience.  
4. **Autonomy** — operational units act freely within defined ethical bounds.  
5. **Auditability** — each decision leaves an auditable trail linked to the Audit Matrix v2.2.

The Decision Ethics Matrix defines which values take precedence when accuracy, speed, or audience impact conflict.

## B2 — Roles & Responsibilities
Defines who does what and how responsibility is distributed.

| Role | Core Function |
|------|----------------|
| Core Council | Strategic oversight, mandate approval, governance review. |
| Curators | Select, prioritize, and contextualize intelligence sources. |
| Editors | Transform curated material into structured narratives. |
| Operators | Manage publishing, archiving, automation, and metrics. |
| AI Advisors | Provide analytical support, pattern recognition, and ethical warnings. |

Delegation follows a clear chain: Council → Curators → Editors → Operators,  
with AI Advisors embedded across all layers for continuous guidance.

## B2.5 — Mandate Handoff (Decision → Execution)
A Mandate Handoff formalizes the transfer of strategic intent from Governance to Operations.  
It converts “why + what” into “how + when”.

**Components of a Mandate:**  
- Origin: who issues it and under which authority.  
- Intent Statement: the explicit purpose and desired impact.  
- Scope & Boundaries: time frame, resources, and limits.  
- Delegation Rules: who executes, with which autonomy.  
- Metrics & Feedback: how success and compliance are measured.  
- Expiration / Renewal: duration and review schedule.

Each active Mandate receives a unique ID (`B2B3-M###`) and is logged at exec.aiflowlabs.studio/core/mandates.

## B3 — Operational Flow — Turning Governance into Motion
Operations translate governance into measurable, repeatable cycles.  
Three nested rhythms sustain the Digest: **Daily**, **Weekly**, and **Publication**.

(...content preserved as in v3-draft...)

## B6 — Integrity & Audit Mechanisms
The system’s immune layer.

1. **Audit Matrix v2.2** — foundation for every review.  
2. **Integrity Score** — weighted measure of ethical and factual accuracy.  
3. **Ethical Checks** — hybrid AI + human verification.  
4. **Failover Protocol** — automatic switch to Safe Digest Mode on anomaly.  
5. **Quarterly Review** — formal governance audit with published report.

Outcome: enduring credibility and resilience.

### B6.1  Impact Override Protocol  
🔁 *Integrated under Legacy Map (v3.1 patch)*  
In exceptional cases, when a strong verified signal requires structural deviation,  
the Core Council may authorize an **Impact Override**.  
- Permitted frequency: *no more than twice per month.*  
- Each override must be justified in writing and logged in the Audit Record.  
- Overrides serve to preserve **meaning and strategic impact** rather than disrupt order.

---

### B6.2  R-MED + O-Log System  
🔁 *Integrated under Legacy Map (v3.1 patch)*  
All exceptions and deviations from established protocol are recorded using the **R-MED (Reasoned Moderation) model**:  
- **R (Reason)** — Why the exception occurred.  
- **M (Mitigation)** — How the risk or deviation was balanced.  
- **E (Effect)** — What immediate and long-term effects are expected.  
- **D (Documentation)** — Reference in the Audit Matrix.  

Each entry is stored in the **O-Log (Operational Logbook)** for traceability.  
These logs become knowledge capital, refining future governance decisions.

---

## Final Statement
The Governance & Ops Framework is the operational skeleton of AI Digest.  
It ensures that every decision connects to action, every action traces back to intent,  
and the system can evolve without losing its ethical compass.
